ISSUE: for some rotations of the sky sphere (e.g. .rotate([90, 331, 0]), far
southern constellations like octans and pavo  took up the whole sky circle,
covering most of the other constellations and making it impossible to mouse over
them.

EXPLANATION: the pologon for those rectangles was inverted, making the interior
of the polygon everything BUT the constellation, instead of the constellation
itself.

From https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2051:

d3.geo requires polygons to wind clockwise around their interior (right-hand
/right-foot winding rule). Your polygon looked like it might be degenerate
(self-intersecting) at first glance (I removed the coincident point for
clarity):
