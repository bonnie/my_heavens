ISSUE: for some rotations of the sky sphere (e.g. .rotate([90, 331, 0]), far
southern constellations like octans and pavo  took up the whole sky circle,
covering most of the other constellations and making it impossible to mouse over
them.

EXPLANATION: the pologon for those rectangles was inverted, making the interior
of the polygon everything BUT the constellation, instead of the constellation
itself.

From https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2051:

d3.geo requires polygons to wind clockwise around their interior (right-hand
/right-foot winding rule). Your polygon looked like it might be degenerate
(self-intersecting) at first glance (I removed the coincident point for
clarity):

It was harder than it may have first seemed: 

    * just finding what was the issue was difficult -- what to google? 

    * what was clockwise for some rotations was anti-clockwise for others (??
      that doesn't seem right, does it?)

    * As an after-the-fact measure, d3.geoArea and skyPath.area did not give
      consistent results. The only consistent thing was screen area
      (and even that wasn't consistent sometimes! Octans was a particular 
      motherf***er, sometimes taking up the whole screen both before *and* after
      reversing the bound verts list)

ISSUE: Calculating rotation of sky sphere from latitude and longitude. 

EXPLANATION: 

from wikipedia: 

The hour angle of a point is the angle between two planes: one containing the
Earth's axis and the zenith (the meridian plane), and the other containing the
Earth's axis and the given point (the hour circle passing through the point).


from the master branch: in Berkeley on 7/1/2017 at 1am, Vega is approx at zenith

vega ra: 18.61560722 (hours) = 279.2341083 degrees
vega dec: +38.78299311 (degrees) -- no coincidence that this is approx the latitude of berkeley

If I rotate the rotate-not-calc sphere to 
    rotateSky(279.2341083, -37.8715926), 
I get Vega at zenith

The question: how to get that ra / dec from lat/lng/time? 

It would seem that pyephem radec_of would do the trick, but it doesn't. Maybe I'm not using it right? 

Basically: I want to provide a dec (the latitude) and altitude (90 degrees), and get the ra

What I ended up doing: providing an hour angle of 0 (the meridian), the time, and the longitude,
and getting the right ascension. Bingo. That was waaaaaaaaay harder than I thought it would be. 
Too much guessing and hoping rather than really thinking about it.

ISSUE: the sky was reversed, because I was looking
at the celestial sphere from the outside, when really we look at it from the
inside.


Needed to reverse coordinates (360 - ra) in the db for constellations not to
be mirror-images
