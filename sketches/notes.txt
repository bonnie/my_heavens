ISSUE: for some rotations of the sky sphere (e.g. .rotate([90, 331, 0]), far
southern constellations like octans and pavo  took up the whole sky circle,
covering most of the other constellations and making it impossible to mouse over
them.

EXPLANATION: the pologon for those rectangles was inverted, making the interior
of the polygon everything BUT the constellation, instead of the constellation
itself.

From https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2051:

d3.geo requires polygons to wind clockwise around their interior (right-hand
/right-foot winding rule). Your polygon looked like it might be degenerate
(self-intersecting) at first glance (I removed the coincident point for
clarity):

It was harder than it may have first seemed: 

    * just finding what was the issue was difficult -- what to google? 

    * what was clockwise for some rotations was anti-clockwise for others (??
      that doesn't seem right, does it?)

    * As an after-the-fact measure, d3.geoArea and skyPath.area did not give
      consistent results. The only consistent thing was screen area

ISSUE: Calculating rotation of sky sphere from latitude and longitude. 

EXPLANATION: 

from wikipedia: 

The hour angle of a point is the angle between two planes: one containing the
Earth's axis and the zenith (the meridian plane), and the other containing the
Earth's axis and the given point (the hour circle passing through the point).

ISSUE: the sky was reversed, because I was looking
at the celestial sphere from the outside, when really we look at it from the
inside.


Needed to reverse coordinates (360 - ra) in the db for constellations not to
be mirror-images
